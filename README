ArduinoProjects:

- rgbledcolorswithtemp
(will add photograph to show circuit)

Calculates temperature with thermistor, if temperature is above 30 celsius,
RGB led becomes red, blue<20<green<30<red 

It can also get string values directly from serial port. To send a message to
Arduino board, write:

-showtemp- for getting temperature
-add- will make rgb brighter
-ext- will make it less brighter
-stop- will stop lighting the led
-bright- will increase brightness to the limit
-delayadd- for loop
-delayext- for loop
-delayzero- no delay on loop

These all functions can be accesible via UsefulScripts/tempserial.py 
                                     and UsefulScripts/serialReader.py


More explanation is coming soon!
